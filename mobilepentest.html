                                            <h3>Static analysis</h3>

                                                <p>This involves analyzing the app's code without running it. This can help identify vulnerabilities such as hardcoded passwords, insecure permissions, and buffer overflows.</p>

                                            <h3>Dynamic analysis</h3>

                                            <h3>Reverse engineering</h3>

                                                <p>This involves decompiling the app's code to understand how it works. This can help identify vulnerabilities that are not easily detectable through static or dynamic analysis.</p>

                                            <h3>Fuzzing</h3>
